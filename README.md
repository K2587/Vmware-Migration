# Vmware-Migration
Importing a VM as an Image Using VM Import/Export
You can use VM Import/Export to import virtual machine (VM) images from your virtualization environment to Amazon EC2 as Amazon Machine Images (AMI), which you can use to launch instances. Subsequently, you can export the VM images from an instance back to your virtualization environment. This enables you to leverage your investments in the VMs that you have built to meet your IT security, configuration management, and compliance requirements by bringing them into Amazon EC2.

###Note

For most VM import needs, we recommend that you use the AWS Server Migration Service. AWS SMS automates the import process (reducing the workload of migrating large VM infrastructures), adds support for incremental updates of changing VMs, and converts your imported VMs into ready-to-use Amazon machine images (AMIs). To get started with AWS SMS, see AWS Server Migration Service.
